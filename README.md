# British Airways - Airline Review Data Analysis Project

This project involves scraping review data from the web, specifically from the website Skytrax. I will focus on collecting reviews about British Airways airline itself, clean and prepare the data, and then perform analysis to uncover insights. This readme provides an overview of my project.

## Data Collection

To start collecting data, I will run Python code that helps gather data from Skytrax. I have created a "data" folder and set my file path accordingly.

## Data Cleaning

Once I have collected the data, it will likely be messy and contain text. Data cleaning is necessary to prepare it for analysis.

## Data Analysis

After cleaning the data, I can perform various analyses to gain insights. I plan to start with:
- Topic Modelling
- Sentiment Analysis
- Word Clouds

I prefer using Python for this task. I will utilize the documentation websites in the Resources section for data analysis.

## Resources

- [Link to Skytrax website](https://www.skytraxratings.com/)
- [Jupyter Notebook for Data Collection](link_to_notebook.ipynb)
- [Documentation for Data Analysis Tools](link_to_documentation)

I have organized my project, including creating a "data" folder to store collected data. I will provide more specific information about my project as I progress, such as the tools and libraries I use for data analysis, and any findings or insights I discover during my analysis.
